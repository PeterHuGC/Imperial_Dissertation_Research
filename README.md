### Implementation steps


First step

1. Added ssh keys to P1 machine, windows and WSL

1. Build initial graph structure  (bipartite and one mode dynamic - ask about structure of dynamic later.)
1. Try centality
1. Get API working for monthly payment of the annual report (get it ready to run it) (based on the sample data.)
1. Look at how to do SQL here!!


Second

1. Do further analysis of text analysis - topic modelling basic structure, LDA, sentiment analysis - and alternative structure from UDA course


Third

1. Try research ideas and look at how to tell a story
1. Create notebook template
1. 8 page limit. (Ask about the limit here.)


#### Problem

Computat tables missing - try to see how to fix this later!!

Otherwise do this manually.

#### dependent variable candidates

1. Research expense ratio (as a share of total value)
2. 


#### Event study

Take interesting events, and period dummy (events) e.g. Pandemic, financial crisis - contextual

- Need to take financial crisis before hand.
- Check hypothesis for these.

Look at some papers later - for which factors are meaningful.


##### Event study consideration for the future

1. need to consider lag
1. starting cannot be used as DV
1. usually the event in the middle is what's most important.
    - There is many endogeneity issues with panel data with instruments (check Bayesian approach)
