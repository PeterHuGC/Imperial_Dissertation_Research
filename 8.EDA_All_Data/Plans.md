Finish the feature generation for everything, LDA - hold out set - what to do there? Just hold out and then run for everything as seen before, unsupervised approach and fully justified!!


Joining togeter, use the graphs created get the node id from everything in each year, and get everything needed

Get the graph for all years to get all nodes - or concatenate them together.

Director level details to merge in a bi-partite manner though (since now these are in edges), what should be done here? Use the melt approach as seen before!!

Here you can take the scores and features that's needed, from seeded LDA as seen before.
